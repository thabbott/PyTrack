# PyTrack
Particle tracking for fluids experiments. This code is new and relatively untested, so don't be shy about opening an issue if you try to use it and run into problems.

You can create a Conda environment for the particle tracker using the environment.txt file in this repository:
```
conda create --name pytrack --file environment.txt
```

An MP4 file for testing the particle tracker (used in [this demo](https://vimeo.com/682323089)) is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G3cqyRJSC0-zR0z1_zTEUU8DXOLQbLro/view?usp=sharing.
