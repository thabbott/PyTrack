# PyTrack
Particle tracking for fluids experiments. This code is new and relatively untested, so don't be shy about opening an issue if you try to use it and run into problems.

If you're running on macOS, you may be able to create a Conda environment for the particle tracker using the environment.txt file in this repository:
```
conda create --name pytrack --file environment.txt
```
The environment.txt file is platform-specific and will not work on other operating systems. I'll try to provide a better way to create the conda environment soon.

An MP4 file for testing the particle tracker (used in [this demo](https://vimeo.com/682323089)) is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G3cqyRJSC0-zR0z1_zTEUU8DXOLQbLro/view?usp=sharing.
